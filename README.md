## Summary of Insights
### Cost Type
- In Q4 2018, there is a dip in administrative and research & development costs
- 2023 had increased spending in marketing and research & development
### Plan Type
- 4x increase in revenue for both Premium and Ad users since 2017
- Users with ads still artibuted to earnings despite not paying for the service (likely active users only)
### User Type
- ARPU stayed consistent for both Premium and Ad users throughout the years
- Ad users made up most of the userbase despite premium accounting for ~90% of the revenue

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- Investigate what the overall cost spending spike in 2022 as well as the Q1 2023 dip in marketing costs are attributed to
- Consider the revenue contribution for active and non-active users to determine how impactful engagement is to profits
- While MAUs and revenue increased over the years, there was a decrease in ARPMAU which should be investigated
- Inclusion of data such as length of Ad and Premium subscription can help determine conversion rate
